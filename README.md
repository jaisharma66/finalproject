Hello! I am going to be writing quite a short readme for this project. I will walk through every file quickly.

Firstly, we have chat.js. This is the area where users can communicate with each other, and the code is from project2. The problem
that occured was that I rewrote the code completely in a new format, however it did not work properly, and thus I had to use code from
the previous project to make this section of the code work.

*** DISCLAIMER *** I DO NOT CLAIM ANY OF THE CODE THAT IS COMMENTED IN THE FILE. IT WAS ACCESSED FROM GOOGLE WITH GOOGLE'S PERMISSION
AS THEY RECCOMEND IT TO AS THE BEST WAY TO RETRIEVE EVENTS AND A SAMPLE. WHERE I HAVE COMMENTED IN THE FILE IS MY OWN CODE, BUT THAT
ALSO RELIED IN GOOGLE'S DOCS. *** DISCLAIMER ***

The next file is index.js. Index.js deals with the calendar API which I accessed from google. Google provide excellent documentation for
their API. As mentioned above, they allow for programmers to use some code to display a user's own events on a website. Adding an event
was my own code that I used the documentation to help write.

Announcements.html has the calendar API Implementation

Chat.html has the chat implementation

index.html has the main page which also has 2 countdown timers

layout.html is the layout for the website

resources.html is where the Newsapi sits, where I access their data. I used their documentation to acces News

application.py is commented, but is where everything major occursâ‰¥

client_secret.json is the client secret key to acces the calendar api.
